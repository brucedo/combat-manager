A combat manager for shadowrun TTRPG

Shadowrun is a fun table-top RPG setting set in some arbitrary semi-distant now-future.  It's better to think of it as an alternate reality.

The game and the setting are fun - but the adventure system, and especially the combat system, is pretty micro-management intense.  It would not be incorrect to refer to it as a "tabletop game as imagined by wargamers."

The heavy ruleset tends to lend itself well to really interesting customizations, but is pretty offputting ot new players.  I should know - I am one.  This project aims to fix this to at least some extent by providing a computerized co-pilot to track the progress of combat for both GMs and players alike.  It does not aim to take over any of the creative duties of the GM - settings, descriptions, encounter design and all other aspects of the game are really outside the scope of this project.  I just don't want to have to try to track all of the minutiae of SR combat on top of having to visualize up to 3 distinct worlds and everyone's position in them.

We're at a very early stage - so don't expect much.  Or anything, really.  But if you're patient, maybe we'll give you something good.
